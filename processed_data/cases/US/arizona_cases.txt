This file contains scraped data from the COVID-19 map for Arizona. 
It contains case counts over time for Arizona by zip code (dashboard: 
https://adhsgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/84b7f701060641ca8bd9ea0717790906).
Note that some of the data is reported in intervals, e.g. 1-5 cases or 6-10 
cases. These are placed in the CSV as is--they are *not* changed to NA's or 
numbers.
The CSV file is generated by pull_arcgis_data.py, which should be run once a day.
